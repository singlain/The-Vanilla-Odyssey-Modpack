## The Vanilla Odyssey is a Vanilla-like modpack that tries to keep the perfect balance between a heavily-modded and vanilla-like experience. 
### The main focus of this mod is Create Mod, Farmer's Delight and addons connecting these two, as well a complete combat overhaul, sounds overhaul, horses overhaul, villager trading rebalance and A LOT of QoL Mods.
